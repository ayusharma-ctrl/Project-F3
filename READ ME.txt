Note: we are not using HTML5 Geolocation Api to fetch the user location
      because this API will fetch the user's live location and for this,
      user have to grant the location access to the browser, and turn on 
      the device location as well. Else it will throw an error - 'unable to access'
      
//that's how we use HTML5 Geolocation API
//check whether browser installed on user's device will support functionality or not
if (!navigator.geolocation) {
    console.log('Geolocation is not supported by your browser');
  } 
  else {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, error);
  }
}

//success function - it will run only if user will allow the browser to access the location and turn on the device location
function success(position) {
    console.log(position.coords.latitude);
    console.log(position.coords.longitude);
}

//error function - it will run if user will not allow the browser to access the location
function error() {
    console.log('Unable to retrieve your location');
}
